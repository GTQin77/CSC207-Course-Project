# CSC207-Course-Project

This repository stores the course project for CSC207 from Team JAJA. 
We are making a day trip planner app, where based on user input and location, it will return a sequence of local meals, activities, and events for them to experience throughout the day.

In this app, you will be able to get three meals and activity recommendations by simply inputting a sentence to describe what vibe you want for the day. You will also be able to delete events that you don't want and view past events that you had for the previous day's plan. At the end of the day, you will get three words that summarize the vibe of the day.
